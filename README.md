In this project, we built a website using Flask for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JS for the frontend. This website displays grocery products that can be sorted by name and price. Adding items to the cart is possible and there is also an ability to checkout the items.

Options to control what dataset to use and what to sort by are given. This helped to compare the algorithms. Creation of a custom hybrid sorting algorithm is also finished.

To Run:
1. Make sure to install Python.
2. Clone repository.
3. Install prerequisites.
4. Run the Flask app using "set FLASK_APP=main" followed by "flask run".

Modify compare page to run trials. It must be edited manually based on dataset size and sorting algorithms to choose and display.
